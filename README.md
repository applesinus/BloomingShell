 My first 2d puzzle game on Unity

Okay, basically it should be a small game to participate in Cozy Spring Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/cozy-spring-jam-2023-)
But i couldn't finish even playable demo in 3 days so I decided just finish this job.

CREDITS:
All code was written by me, applesinus (Apelsin4ik).
All images was drew by pie_lina.
Orange team isn't even an organisation, it's literally a team of two people. We work for free just for fun and portfolio.

If you're an HR and wanna look at my code, PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE! In this project it's terrible, I know. Please, take a look at my other projects!



Update log:

===== 2023.05.09 =====
Now it's unplayable thing, can't say it's even a demo.
Now it's in alpha.
