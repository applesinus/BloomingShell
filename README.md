My first 2d puzzle game on Unity 
Okay, basically it should be a small game to participate in Cozy Spring Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/cozy-spring-jam-2023-).
But i couldn't finish even playable demo in 3 days so I decided not to send anything.
Anyway, after almost a year of downtime I got back to the development.

CREDITS:  
All code was written by me, applesinus (Apelsin4ik).  
All images was drew by pie_lina.  
Orange team isn't even an organisation, it's literally a team of two people. We work for free, just for fun and portfolio.

DEV LOG:

**Oct 2024**: Work in progress again. After a long period of downtime I decided to finish this project. Hopefully, in Jan 2025 it will (pre)release.
